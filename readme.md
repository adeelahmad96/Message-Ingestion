Package Lambda Code:

bash
Copy code
zip index.zip index.js
Upload to S3:

bash
Copy code
aws s3 cp index.zip s3://<Your_S3_Bucket>/path/to/your/index.zip
Deploy CloudFormation Stack:

bash
Copy code
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name WhatsAppWebhookStack --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
Step 4: Set Up Webhooks
Go to the Meta App Dashboard, create a Business Type App, add the Webhooks Product, and subscribe to the WhatsApp webhooks with the endpoint URL provided in the CloudFormation stack output.

By following these steps, you will have a complete backend application set up to handle WhatsApp webhook payloads, authenticate them, and store them in an SQS queue.
